Signal Generator


PB0 (LEFT_CHANNEL_PIN) and PB1 (RIGHT_CHANNEL_PIN) are used for PWM audio output, handling the left and right audio channels, respectively.
PB2 (BUTTON_PIN) is used for the button input to cycle through the channels and stop the tone generation.

Available Pins:
Given this setup:

Pin 3 (PB3) remains available for additional functionalities beyond what's implemented in your code.
Pin 4 (GND) and Pin 8 (VCC) are reserved for power connections and don't count toward GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) availability.
Pin 1 (PB5/RESET) is typically used as the RESET pin but can be reconfigured as an additional I/O pin if you disable its reset functionality. However, doing so comes with implications for programming and debugging the ATtiny85, as mentioned earlier.
Considering Additional Functionalities:
With PB3 available, you could add functionalities such as:

An additional button for controlling other features like changing the tone frequency without reprogramming.
An LED indicator for visual feedback on the current mode or frequency.
A light sensor (using PB3 as an analog input with ADC) to adjust the volume or change modes based on ambient light, adding an element of interactivity based on environmental conditions.
Recommendations for Spare Pin Usage:
LED Indicator: Given the audio-centric nature of your project, using PB3 to drive an LED could provide immediate visual feedback about the state of the device, such as indicating which channel is currently active or if the device is in the "stopped" state.
Additional Control: If your project's usability would benefit from more nuanced control, consider using PB3 for an additional input mechanism. This could be another button or a switch that allows users to not only cycle through output channels but also adjust other parameters like frequency ranges dynamically.
Incorporating any of these suggestions would require updating the initIO function to configure PB3 according to its new role and potentially modifying the main loop or ISR to handle the added functionality appropriately. Always ensure that any additional components or wiring do not interfere with the existing operation, particularly the precise timing required for accurate tone generation and PWM control.
